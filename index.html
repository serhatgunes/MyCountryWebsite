                            <h3>Etymology</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                The name of Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye) is based on the ethnonym Türk. The first recorded use of the term "Türk" or "Türük" as an autonym is contained in the Old Turkic inscriptions of the Göktürks (Celestial Turks) of Central Asia (c. 8th century).<br />
                                <br />
                                The English name Turkey first appeared in the late 14th century and is derived from Medieval Latin Turchia.
                            The Greek cognate of this name, Tourkia (Greek: Τουρκία) was used by the Byzantine emperor and scholar Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in his book De Administrando Imperio,though in his use, "Turks" always referred to Magyars.<br />
                                <br />
                                Similarly, the medieval Khazar Empire, a Turkic state on the northern shores of the Black and Caspian seas, was referred to as Tourkia (Land of the Turks) in Byzantine sources.The medieval Arabs referred to the Mamluk Sultanate as al-Dawla al-Turkiyya (State of Turkey).
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The Ottoman Empire was sometimes referred to as Turkey or the Turkish Empire among its European contemporaries.

                            <h3>History</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                The history of Turkey, understood as the history of the region now forming the territory of the Republic of Turkey, includes the history of both Anatolia (the Asian part of Turkey) and Eastern Thrace (the European part of Turkey).

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                For times predating the Ottoman period, a distinction must be made between the history of the Turkic peoples, and the history of the territories now forming the Republic of Turkey, essentially the histories of ancient Anatolia and Thrace.

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The name Turkey is derived from Middle Latin Turchia, i.e. the "land of the Turks", historically referring to an entirely different territory of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, which fell under the control of Turkic peoples in the early medieval period.

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                From the time when parts of what is now Turkey was conquered by Turks, the history of Turkey spans the medieval history of the Seljuk Empire, the medieval to modern history of the Ottoman Empire, and the history of the Republic of Turkey since the 1920s.

                            <h3>Administrative divisions</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                Turkey has a unitary structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Turkey doesn't have a federal system, and the provinces are subordinate to the central government in Ankara. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors (vali) and town governors (kaymakam). 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors (belediye başkanı) or elected by constituents.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies (belediye meclisi) for decision-making on municipal issues.

                            <h3>Politics</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                Turkey is a parliamentary representative democracy. Since its foundation as a republic in 1923, Turkey has developed a strong tradition of secularism.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Turkey's constitution governs the legal framework of the country. It sets out the main principles of government and establishes Turkey as a unitary centralised state. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The President of the Republic is the head of state and has a largely ceremonial role. The president is elected for a five-year term by direct elections and Tayyip Erdoğan is the first president elected by direct voting.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Executive power is exercised by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers which make up the government, while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the Constitutional Court is charged with ruling on the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution.

                                The EU – Turkey Customs Union in 1995 led to an extensive liberalisation of tariff rates, and forms one of the most important pillars of Turkey's foreign trade policy.

                            <h3>Culture</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                The culture of Turkey combines a heavily diverse and heterogeneous set of elements that have been derived from the various cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean (West Asian) and Central Asian region and to a lesser degree, Eastern European, and Caucasian traditions. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Many of these traditions were initially brought together by the Ottoman Empire, a multi-ethnic and multi-religious state.

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                During the early years of the republic, the government invested a large amount of resources into fine arts such as paintings, sculpture and architecture. This was done as both a process of modernization and of creating a cultural identity. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Because of the different historical factors defining the Turkish identity, the culture of Turkey combines clear efforts of modernization and Westernization undertaken in varying degrees since the 1700s, with a simultaneous desire to maintain traditional religious and historical values.

                                <br />
                                <br />
