                        Ankara is a province of Turkey, the capital and second most populous city,

                            <h3>Toponymy</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                As with many ancient cities, Ankara has gone by several names over the ages. It has been identified with the Hittite cult center Ankuwaš, although this remains a matter of debate.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                In classical antiquity and during the medieval period, the city was known as Ánkyra (Ἄγκυρα, lit "anchor") in Greek and Ancyra in Latin; the Galatian Celtic name was probably a similar variant. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Following its annexation by the Seljuk Turks in 1073, the city became known in many European languages as Angora; it was also known in Ottoman Turkish as Engürü. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The form "Angora" is preserved in the names of breeds of many different kinds of animals, and in the names of several locations in the US (see Angora).

                            <h3>History</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                The region's history can be traced back to the Bronze Age Hattic civilization, which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the Hittites, in the 10th century BC by the Phrygians, and later by the Lydians, Persians, Greeks, Galatians, Romans, Byzantines, and Turks (the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, the Ottoman Empire and Turkey).

                            <h3>Climalite</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                Ankara has a dry summer continental climate (Dsa) under the Köppen climate classification, with some regions of the province having a warm summer subtype (Dsb) depending on elevation. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Under the Trewartha climate classification, Ankara has a middle latitude steppe climate (BSks). 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Due to its elevation and inland location, Ankara has cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers, with cool nightly temperatures. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Ankara lies in USDA Hardiness zone 7b, and its annual average precipitation is fairly low at 400 millimeters (16 in), nevertheless precipitation can be observed throughout the year. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Monthly mean temperatures range from 0.3 °C (32.5 °F) in January to 23.5 °C (74.3 °F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.02 °C (53.6 °F).

                            <h3>Politics</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                Ankara is politically a triple battleground between the ruling conservative Justice and Development Party (AKP), the opposition Kemalist centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP) and the nationalist far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). 
    <br />
                                <br />
                                The province of Ankara is divided into 25 districts. The CHP's key and almost only political stronghold in Ankara lies within the central area of Çankaya, which is the city's most populous district. 
    <br />
                                <br />
                                While the CHP has always gained between 60 and 70% of the vote in Çankaya since 2002, political support elsewhere throughout Ankara is minimal.

                                <br />
                                The high population within Çankaya, as well as Yenimahalle to an extent, has allowed the CHP to take overall second place behind the AKP in both local and general elections, with the MHP a close third, despite the fact that the MHP is politically stronger than the CHP in almost every other district. Overall, the AKP enjoys the most support throughout the city. 
    <br />
                                <br />
                                The electorate of Ankara thus tend to vote in favour of the political right, far more so than the other main cities of Istanbul and İzmir.

                                The Electricity, Gas, Bus General Directorate (EGO) operates the Ankara Metro and other forms of public transportation.

                                Ankara is currently served by a suburban rail named Ankaray (A1) and three subway lines (M1, M2, M3) of the Ankara Metro with about 300,000 total daily commuters, while an additional subway line (M4) is currently under construction. A 3.2 km (2.0 mi) long gondola lift with four stations connects the district of Şentepe to the Yenimahalle metro station.

                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The Ankara Central Station is a major rail hub in Turkey. The Turkish State Railways operates passenger train service from Ankara to other major cities, such as: Istanbul, Eskişehir, Balıkesir, Kütahya, İzmir, Kayseri, Adana, Kars, Elâzığ, Malatya, Diyarbakır, Karabük, Zonguldak and Sivas. Commuter rail also runs between the stations of Sincan and Kayaş.

                                On 13 March 2009, the new Yüksek Hızlı Tren (YHT) high-speed rail service began operation between Ankara and Eskişehir. On 23 August 2011, another YHT high-speed line commercially started its service between Ankara and Konya. On 25 July 2014, the Ankara–Istanbul high-speed line of YHT entered service.

                                The city has exported mohair (from the Angora goat) and Angora wool (from the Angora rabbit) internationally for centuries. 
                         <br />
                                <br />
                                In the 19th century, the city also exported substantial amounts of goat and cat skins, gum, wax, honey, berries, and madder root. It was connected to Constantinople by railway before the First World War, continuing to export mohair, wool, berries, and grain.

                                <br />

                                The Central Anatolia Region is one of the primary locations of grape and wine production in Turkey, and Ankara is particularly famous for its Kalecik Karası and Muscat grapes; and its Kavaklıdere wine, which is produced in the Kavaklıdere neighbourhood within the Çankaya district of the city. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Ankara is also famous for its pears. Another renowned natural product of Ankara is its indigenous type of honey (Ankara Balı) which is known for its light color and is mostly produced by the Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo in the Gazi district, and by other facilities in the Elmadağ, Çubuk and Beypazarı districts.

                            <h3>Demographics</h3>
                            <p align="justify">
                                Ankara had a population of 75,000 in 1927. In 2013, Ankara Province had a population of 5,045,083.

                                <br />
                                <br />

                                When Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As a result, many illegal houses called gecekondu were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.

                                As with all other cities of Turkey, football is the most popular sport in Ankara. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                The city has one football club currently competing in the Turkish Super League: Gençlerbirliği, founded in 1923, is known as the Ankara Gale or the Poppies because of their colors: red and black. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                They were the Turkish Cup winners in 1987 and 2001. Ankaragücü, founded in 1910, is the oldest club in Ankara and is associated with Ankara's military arsenal manufacturing company MKE. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Ankaragücü used to play in the Turkish Super League until being relegated to the TFF First League at the end of the 2011–2012 season.

                                They were the Turkish Cup winners in 1972 and 1981. Gençlerbirliği's B team, Hacettepe SK (formerly known as Gençlerbirliği OFTAŞ) played in the Turkish Super League for a while until being relegated.
